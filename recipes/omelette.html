    <p>It's a classic. Enough said.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Some milk</li>
        <li>Butter (I prefer Kerrigold)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        <li>Salt, garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a half inch slab of butter in a pan under medium low heat</li>
        <li>While the butter is heating, crack three eggs into a bowl and whisk them with a little milk, salt, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is heated and the pan has coated, pour the eggs in, and add some shredded cheese in a line down the center.</li>
        <li>Gently prod the eggs to make sure they arent sticking tto the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the whole egg mass is one unit that is sliding around the pan on the butter, flip it in half.</li>
        <li>After about 45 seconds, flip it over. Let it finish for another 45 seconds or so, then take it out. You're all done!</li>
    </ol>
